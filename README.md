# Atelier B Installation Guide

This project contains the sources for the installation guide of
Atelier B. The guide is in Markdown format.

The shell script `help.sh` provides a command to produce a PDF version.
It may be used as follows:
```bash
. help.sh installation-guide
```
This assumes that pandoc and LaTeX are available.
